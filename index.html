The franchise has won NBA championships in 1999, 2003, 2005, 2007, and 2014. As of May 2015, the Spurs had the highest winning percentage among active NBA franchises. As of May 2017, the Spurs have the best winning percentage of any franchise in the major professional sports leagues in the United States and Canada over the previous three decades. As of April 2019, the Spurs have won 22 division titles since joining the NBA and have only missed the playoffs four times. From 1999-2000 to 2016-17, the Spurs won 50 games each season, setting a record of 18 consecutive 50-win seasons. In the 2018-19 season, the Spurs matched an NBA record for most consecutive playoff appearances with 22. The team's recent success coincides with the tenure of current head coach Gregg Popovich, who has coached the team since 1996.</p>
